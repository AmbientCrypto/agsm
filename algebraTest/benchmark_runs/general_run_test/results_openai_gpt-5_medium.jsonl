The index reading is 8 at time x hours, with the decay process starting near an exponent value of -2 and decreasing by 5 per hour. What is x?\nCrisis press releases must be issued immediately, typically within 24 hours of an incident, to manage media narratives and public perception effectively.\n\nSub-problem 2:\nIn a stack effect ventilation design, one exhaust duct provides an 8-unit air quality credit over (x+6) hours of operation. A second duct provides a 4-unit credit over (x+5) hours. The combined system yields a net credit of 5 per hour. Let x be the design parameter adjustment. What is x?\nTaller buildings experience stronger stack ventilation due to increased height difference between intake and exhaust points.\n\nSub-problem 3:\nArchaeologists unearthed a rectangular shield used by a famous Roman general. Its length was x feet, and the width measured 2 feet less than the length. The artifact's surface area was documented as 24 square feet. Let x be the shield's length.
