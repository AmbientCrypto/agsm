Let the index be `I(t)`.\nThe problem states: \"the decay process starting near an exponent value of -2 and decreasing by 5 per hour.\"\nThis suggests that the exponent of the exponential function is `E(t) = -2 - 5t`.\nSo, the model for the index `I(t)` is `I(t) = e^(E(t)) = e^(-2 - 5t)`.\nWe are given that \"The index reading is 8 at time x hours\".\nSo, `I(x) = 8`.\n`8 = e^(-2 - 5x)`\n\nTo solve for x:\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(8) = -2 - 5x`\n`5x = -2 - ln(8)`\n`x = (-2 - ln(8)) / 5`\n\nUsing `ln(8) ≈ 2.07944154168`:\n`x = (-2 - 2.07944154168) / 5`\n`x = -4.07944154168 / 5`\n`x = -0.815888308336`\n\nThere is only one real numeric solution for x. The problem does not specify that time `x` must be non-negative, and a negative time value is a valid real number representing a point in time before a reference `t=0`.\nThus, `sub_2 = -0.815888308336`.\n\n---\n**Sub-problem 3: Operating hours x**\n\"a yield of 7 tons per operating hour.\"\n\"The initial reactor charge contributes a fixed 14 tons independently.\"\n\"The total output recorded for one batch is 91 tons.\"\nLet x be the operating hours.\n\nThe total output is the sum of the yield from operating hours and the initial charge:\n`Total Output = (Yield per hour * Operating hours) + Initial Charge`\n`91 = (7 * x) + 14`\n\nTo solve for x:\n`91 - 14 = 7x`\n`77 = 7x`\n`x = 77 / 7`\n`x = 11`\n\nThere is only one real numeric solution for x.\nThus, `sub_3 = 11`.\n\n---\n**Final Calculation**\nWe need to compute `2*(sub_1) + 7*(sub_2) + 9*(sub_3)`.\n`sub_1 = -0.75`\n`sub_2 = -0.815888308336`\n`sub_3 = 11`\n\n`2 * sub_1 = 2 * (-0.75) = -1.5`\n`7 * sub_2 = 7 * (-0.815888308336) = -5.711218158352`\n`9 * sub_3 = 9 * (11) = 99`\n\nSumming these values:\n`-1.5 - 5.711218158352 + 99`\n`= 91.788781841648`\n\n```json\n{\"final_answer\": 91.788781841648}\n```", "duration_seconds": 57.520932, "started_at": "2025-09-24T06:02:04.451600Z", "completed_at": "2025-09-24T06:03:01.972555Z", "error_reason": null, "usage": {"promptTokenCount": 470, "candidatesTokenCount": 1153, "totalTokenCount": 10439, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 470}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 8816}, "provider_error": null, "parsed_json": {"final_answer": 91.788781841648}}

If there are multiple variables, we select the numerically largest value among their chosen solutions. If no real solution exists or is physically meaningful, we use 0.0. Finally, we compute a linear expression using these `sub_i` values.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown for each sub-problem:\n\n**Sub-problem 1:**\nThe problem describes an exponential decay model where the index reading is 8 at time x hours. The decay process \"starting near an exponent value of -2 and decreasing by 5 per hour.\"\nA standard exponential decay model is $A(t) = A_0 e^{-kt}$.\n\"decreasing by 5 per hour\" implies the decay rate constant $k=5$. So, $A(t) = A_0 e^{-5t}$.\n\"The index reading is 8 at time x hours\" means $A(x) = 8$, so $A_0 e^{-5x} = 8$.\nThe phrase \"starting near an exponent value of -2\" is ambiguous. Let's interpret it as the exponent in the decay factor (i.e., $-kt$) being -2 *at time x*.\nSo, $-5x = -2$, which gives $x = 2/5 = 0.4$.\nSubstituting this back into $A_0 e^{-5x} = 8$: $A_0 e^{-2} = 8$, so $A_0 = 8e^2$.\nThe model is $A(t) = 8e^2 e^{-5t}$. At $t=x=0.4$, $A(0.4) = 8e^2 e^{-5(0.4)} = 8e^2 e^{-2} = 8e^0 = 8$. This is consistent.\nThis interpretation yields a positive value for x, which is typically expected for time.\nSolution: $x = 0.4$.\n`sub_1 = 0.4`\n\n**Sub-problem 2:**\nDuct 1 credit rate: $8 / (x+6)$ units per hour.\nDuct 2 credit rate: $4 / (x+5)$ units per hour.\nCombined rate: $8 / (x+6) + 4 / (x+5) = 5$.\nMultiply by $(x+6)(x+5)$ to clear denominators:\n$8(x+5) + 4(x+6) = 5(x+6)(x+5)$\n$8x + 40 + 4x + 24 = 5(x^2 + 11x + 30)$\n$12x + 64 = 5x^2 + 55x + 150$\n$5x^2 + 43x + 86 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$x = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{43^2 - 4(5)(86)}}{2(5)}$\n$x = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{1849 - 1720}}{10}$\n$x = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{129}}{10}$.\nThe two solutions are $x_1 = \\frac{-43 + \\sqrt{129}}{10}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{-43 - \\sqrt{129}}{10}$.\nFor the periods of operation to be valid, $x+6 > 0$ and $x+5 > 0$, which means $x > -5$.\n$x_1 \\approx \\frac{-43 + 11.3578}{10} \\approx \\frac{-31.6422}{10} \\approx -3.1642$.

For each sub-problem, we must find all real numeric solutions. If there are multiple solutions for a variable, we select the numerically largest one. If there are multiple variables, we select the numerically largest value among their chosen solutions. If no real solution exists or is physically meaningful, we use 0.0. Finally, we compute a linear expression using these `sub_i` values.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown for each sub-problem:\n\n**Sub-problem 1:**\nThe problem describes an exponential decay model where the index reading is 8 at time x hours. The decay process \"starting near an exponent value of -2 and decreasing by 5 per hour.\"\nA standard exponential decay model is $A(t) = A_0 e^{-kt}$.\n\"decreasing by 5 per hour\" implies the decay rate constant $k=5$. So, $A(t) = A_0 e^{-5t}$.\n\"The index reading is 8 at time x hours\" means $A(x) = 8$, so $A_0 e^{-5x} = 8$.\nThe phrase \"starting near an exponent value of -2\" is ambiguous. Let's interpret it as the exponent in the decay factor (i.e., $-kt$) being -2 *at time x*.\nSo, $-5x = -2$, which gives $x = 2/5 = 0.4$.\nSubstituting this back into $A_0 e^{-5x} = 8$: $A_0 e^{-2} = 8$, so $A_0 = 8e^2$.\nThe model is $A(t) = 8e^2 e^{-5t}$. At $t=x=0.4$, $A(0.4) = 8e^2 e^{-5(0.4)} = 8e^2 e^{-2} = 8e^0 = 8$. This is consistent.\nThis interpretation yields a positive value for x, which is typically expected for time.\nSolution: $x = 0.4$.\n`sub_1 = 0.4`\n\n**Sub-problem 2:**\nDuct 1 credit rate: $8 / (x+6)$ units per hour.\nDuct 2 credit rate: $4 / (x+5)$ units per hour.\nCombined rate: $8 / (x+6) + 4 / (x+5) = 5$.\nMultiply by $(x+6)(x+5)$ to clear denominators:\n$8(x+5) + 4(x+6) = 5(x+6)(x+5)$\n$8x + 40 + 4x + 24 = 5(x^2 + 11x + 30)$\n$12x + 64 = 5x^2 + 55x + 150$\n$5x^2 + 43x + 86 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$x = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{43^2 - 4(5)(86)}}{2(5)}$\n$x = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{1849 - 1720}}{10}$\n$x = \\frac{-43 \\pm \\sqrt{129}}{10}$.\nThe two solutions are $x_1 = \\frac{-43 + \\sqrt{129}}{10}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{-43 - \\sqrt{129}}{10}$.\nFor the periods of operation to be valid, $x+6 > 0$ and $x+5 > 0$, which means $x > -5$.\n$x_1 \\approx \\frac{-43 + 11.3578}{10} \\approx \\frac{-31.6422}{10} \\approx -3.1642$. This satisfies $x > -5$.\n$x_2 \\approx \\frac{-43 - 11.3578}{10} \\approx \\frac{-54.3578}{10} \\approx -5.4358$. This does not satisfy $x > -5$.\nSo, only $x_1$ is a valid solution.\n`sub_2 = (-43 + sqrt(129)) / 10`\n\n**Sub-problem 3:**\nLength = x feet.\nWidth = (x-2) feet.\nArea = x(x-2) = 24.\n$x^2 - 2x - 24 = 0$.\nFactoring: $(x-6)(x+4) = 0$.\nSolutions: $x=6$ or $x=-4$.\nSince length must be positive, $x=6$.

This is positive.\n$x_2 \\approx \\frac{-11 - 12.5299}{6} \\approx \\frac{-23.5299}{6} \\approx -3.9217$.
